                College is a time you will always remember, a chance to discover the highs and lows of life.
            </h4>
            <div class="bodyText">
                <div class="imageHolder right" style="max-width: 40%">

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have heard the constant advice from older generations to "make the most" of these four years--an encouraging sentiment if you know what you're doing, but a looming sense of pressure and urgency if you don't.
                    In fact, you, like many of your peers, have probably been subjected to many instances of such pressures related to your time in college. Everything in higher education is, well, heightened, from your opportunities to your worries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This website aims to break down those worries and put into perspective what the modern-day pursuit of happiness entails.
                </p>
                <h3>Where These Misconceptions Come From</h3>
                <div class="imageHolder right" style="width: 300px">
                    <iframe src="//cdn.bannersnack.com/banners/bxp5w9m37/embed/index.html?userId=33136526&t=1512954745" width="300" height="230" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
                </div>

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a child you have probably been subjected to the ideology that good grades are everything.
                    The idea that only through good grades will you be able to attend a top university, and then, only through obtaining good grades at the university will you be able to graduate and find a high paying job which is then equated with finding happiness in our modern society.
                    Thus, problems in education occur where you study in order to test well rather than trying to learn the material.
                </p>
                <div class="imageHolder" style="max-width: 40%">

                </div>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, you may attempt to study in fields that are currently ranked as the highest paying careers.
                    This is great if you truly have an interest in that area, but most likely than not, you are only studying the subject for that end goal of money.
                    This makes your college experience extremely bitter as you spend more time relative to your classmates, struggling to understand material that you find extremely dry.
                    This is a major problem in mentality that has resulted from the workings of modern society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As said by prominent researcher and psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, “[n]owadays the logic of reducing everything to a quantifiable measures has made <strong>the dollar the common metric</strong> by which to <strong>evaluate every aspect of human action</strong>.  The worth of a person and of a person’s accomplishments are determined by the price they fetch in the marketplace.” Society has taught everyone to value how they look on paper, such as transcripts, college rankings, and resumes, over anything else.
                    This viewpoint directly comes from society’s faulty view of success, believing that monetary success equates to happiness.
                </p>
                <div class="bigQuote right" style="font-size: 28px;">
                    “After following a group of lottery winners (the study) concluded that despite their sudden increase in wealth their happiness was no different from that of people struck by traumas.”
                </div>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Csikszentmihalyi cites a study involving of many wealthy people across the United States, it was found that some of the wealthiest people have levels of happiness that are not too too far from individuals with average income.
                    From this study, it is seen that having more money does not equate to higher levels of happiness.
                    To explain this phenomenon, Csikszentmihalyi explains the concept of “relative deprivation”.
                    It is the observation that “[i]f people strive for a certain level of affluence thinking that it will make them happy, they find that on reaching it, they become very quickly habituated, and at that point they start hankering for the next level of income, property, or good health.”

                <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people have attempted to define happiness, and for this website, our definition will be taken from modern psychologists who indicate that happiness is a sense of well-being. <br/> </div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pursuit of discovering what makes people happy, researchers have discovered a gene mutation within humans that determine our happiness. This gene controls our happiness set point, or our sense of happiness disregarding recent events that may make us more happy or more sad. That is, after a long time, even if you win the lottery, or lose a limb, eventually, you will return to a certain level of happiness. <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in our pursuit of happiness, this particular information gives us no information other than the fact that we are born with unequal starting points of happiness, and that some people will always be happier than others. <h3>So what can we do?</h3>

                    “40 percent of our happiness is determined by intentional activity” <span>-Sonja</span> Lyubomirsky

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the research of Sonja Lyubomirsky 50% of our happiness is based on that set point.  Another 10% is based on our circumstances which are largely unchangeable.  However a full 40% is based on our mindset which is entirely up to us and changeable at any time.</div>

                <h3>Relationships With Others</h3>
                <div class="bigQuote right" style="font-size: 32px">
                    “The biggest take home from a lot of this, is that the quality of people’s relationships are way more important than what we thought they were—not just for emotional well-being but also for physical health”
                </div>

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam Piore in his essay about technologies effect on happiness shows this very well.
                    Relationships with others are really a staple part of the Human expeirience, and as such we are wired to enjoy them and find them more fulfilling than almost anything else. He writes,
                    “I was finding hard data to support the fact that your relationships are the most important single thing in your well-being. It’s been gratifying to find support for something as sentimental as love.”</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    So we should be out trying to make new relationships and strengthen our existing ones as much as possible.  They are the best way to be happy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <br/>
                    However we often lose sight of this when in our relationships are pitted against our search for money
                    <br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even thought it is one of the most valued and lusted after things in our society, there is very little correlation between more happiness and more money especially beyond a certain threshold.  Now as college students, many of us are likely able to successfully argue that we are below that threshold and so need to spend our four years here on a grind to make enough to reach that threshold.</p><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However if you start focusing mainly on certain rewards, other things will start to atrophy.  We are here as students mainly because it is the way that the world tells us to be successful.  We want to go to school, get a good job and then make money.  However the focus put on making money <strong>will</strong> detract from the other more important ways of making you happy like relationships and getting out and doing things.

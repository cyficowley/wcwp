                College is a time you will always remember, a chance to discover the highs and lows of life.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have heard the constant advice from older generations to "make the most" of these four years--an encouraging sentiment if you know what you're doing, but a looming sense of pressure and urgency if you don't.
                    In fact, you, like many of your peers, have probably been subjected to many instances of such pressures related to your time in college. Everything in higher education is, well, heightened, from your opportunities to your worries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This website aims to break down those worries and put into perspective what the modern-day pursuit of happiness entails.
                </p>
                <h3>Where These Misconceptions Come From</h3>
                <div class="imageHolder right" style="width: 300px">

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You probably often heard growing up that good grades are everything. Whether or not you agreed with that statement, the mindset was likely perpetuated that only through good grades would you be able to attend a top university, and then, only through a good GPA at the university would you be able to find a high paying job, success, and, ultimately, happiness. As a result of this type of reasoning, it’s now common to see students valuing grades over learning or choosing to study in “financially secure” fields over those in which they actually have an interest and passion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This skewed prioritizing is a major problem in mentality and an obstacle to your experiencing college to its fullest potential. As prominent researcher and psychologist <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi/publication/232506901_If_we_are_so_rich_why_aren%27t_we_happy/links/55ad6a1a08aee079921e258b/If-we-are-so-rich-why-arent-we-happy.pdf">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a> explains, “Nowadays the logic of reducing everything to quantifiable measures has made the dollar the common metric by which to evaluate every aspect of human action. The worth of a person and of a person’s accomplishments are determined by the price they fetch in the marketplace.”

                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Society has taught students to value how they look on paper, such as transcripts, college rankings, and resumes, over anything else. This viewpoint directly comes from society’s faulty view of success, believing that monetary success equates to happiness. However, Csikszentmihalyi cites a study which found that the happiness levels of some of the wealthiest people in the U.S. are just slightly above those of individuals with average income. The study seems to backup the old saying that money cannot buy happiness.

                </p>
                <div class="bigQuote right" style="font-size: 28px;">
                    “After following a group of lottery winners (the study) concluded that despite their sudden increase in wealth their happiness was no different from that of people struck by traumas.”
                </div>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, money can certainly buy added pressures and dissatisfaction. This can be seen in the phenomenon Csikszentmihalyi calls “relative deprivation.” It is the observation that “[i]f people strive for a certain level of affluence thinking that it will make them happy, they find that on reaching it, they become very quickly habituated, and at that point they start hankering for the next level of income, property, or good health.”</p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put it in more relevant terms, even if you graduate from a top level college, reach those milestones that pad your resume, and succeed in finding a financially stable job, eventually you will find yourself unhappy with your life. You’ll likely fall into the trap of comparing yourself to others making more money, buying more trendy phones, or just appearing more successful as a whole. The root of this dissatisfaction is <strong>the misconception that monetary success is happiness</strong>, and more money means more happiness. So if money isn’t the path to happiness, what is? To answer that, this abstract idea of happiness must first be understood.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happiness as defined by academic psychologists is the term “subjective well-being.” In the early days of attempting to measure happiness, psychologists turned to surveys, which quickly proved  an accurate and unreliable source of information. In the pursuit of a more concrete method of measuring happiness, researchers chanced upon a gene mutation that is now known to determine happiness.

                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, this gene determines your set point happiness. The idea of a set point is the mean level of happiness, disregarding life events that may make you more happy or more sad. That is, even if you win the lottery or lose a limb, eventually, you will return to a certain level of happiness. According to researchers, as much as 50% of the set point is immediately determined at birth by this gene.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this mean those with a lower set point are forever doomed to be unhappy? Well, another way of looking at this is that although happiness is somewhat determined at birth, there is still leeway. There is still 50% of an individual’s happiness undetermined by the luck of genetics. As Csikszentmihalyi would say,

                How to Achieve Happiness

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the other 50% of happiness that you can actually control? Sonja Lyubomirsky, professor of psychology at UC Riverside and author of several works about “sustainable” happiness, believes that “40% of [someone’s] happiness is determined by intentional activity.” Another 10% is based on circumstances, such as wealth or changes in lifestyle, which have surprisingly little impact in comparison.
                </p>
                <div class="imageHolder bodyText" style="text-align: center; max-width: 400px">

                </span>
                </div>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly half of an individual’s potential for happiness depends on this concept of intentional activity, which covers a wide variety of possibilities. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most fundamental  is the attitude you have towards the world. As Lyubomirsky explains it, “happiness, more than anything, is a state of mind, a way of perceiving and approaching ourselves and the world in which we reside.” Once you realize that you are not as much at mercy to the events of the world as you might think, you’ll find that circumstance is not the most significant factor contributing to happiness levels—attitude is. Along that line of thought, as you focus your attitude on a more positive outlook on life, you should also focus your time and energy on following your passions.</p>
                <div class="imageHolder right">
                    <img src="images/hobbies-2.jpg">
                </div>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to a change in attitude, intentional actions include well, actions. Instead of staying in your dorms all day, find something that you are passionate about, be it music, sports, cooking, or anything else that sparks your interest, because “there’s a great deal of room to improve our happiness by the things we do, our intentional activities,” according to Lyubomirsky.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run, letting your four years revolve around stress over money and grades will only take away from your college experience. Instead, put more time and energy into what makes you happier. Pursue hobbies, learn for sake of learning, and take classes outside your general requirements. Just as these activities will shape your character, there is another crucial element of happiness which will surely make lasting impacts on your life even after college: relationships.

                <h3>Relationships With Others</h3>
                <div class="bigQuote right" style="font-size: 32px">
                    “The biggest take home from a lot of this, is that the quality of people’s relationships are way more important than what we thought they were—not just for emotional well-being but also for physical health”
                </div>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In award-winning journalist Adam Piore’s article, “<a href="http://nautil.us/issue/28/2050/what-technology-cant-change-about-happiness">What Technology Can’t Change About Happiness</a>,” he highlights that close relationships and social connections are the bottom line for what makes an individual happy. Piore cited one important study done by George Vaillant which concluded that within a list of ten late-life accomplishments, which included earning a high income, “only four were highly correlated with success on all the measures, and those all had to do with relationships.”
                </p>

                <div class="imageHolder" style="max-width: 40%; margin-bottom:40px;">
                    <img src="images/money.jpg">
                </div>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, it is seen that the only things in life that can really weather time and circumstance  boil down to strong, well-developed connections with others, and that money does not play an important role in happiness at all. In fact, money has been shown to undermine relationships as seen in researcher Kathleen Vohs study, where “the merest hint of money led to a tendency for folks to feel confident, but also feel more distant from others”(Diener and Biswas-Diener 173). This not only explains why the idea of money equating to happiness is problematic, it also highlights the significance of lasting bonds to an individual’s happiness.
                </p>
                <div class="bigQuote right" style="width: 35%">
                    Just get out there and meet new people.  You will become happier.
                </div>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, a great way to boost happiness levels would be to form connections. Join extracurricular clubs, and socialize with your peers. Strike up a conversation, or make an effort to meet new people. Interact widely and invest deeply as you build relationships with people. In this process, you might just come across great friendships that last for the rest of your life.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that you know what elements do and do not equate to happiness, you have the power to create happiness for yourself. As cheesy as it may sound, it’s true:

                <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people have attempted to define happiness, and for this website, our definition will be taken from modern psychologists who indicate that happiness is a sense of well-being. <br/> </div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pursuit of discovering what makes people happy, researchers have discovered a gene mutation within humans that determine our happiness. This gene controls our happiness set point, or our sense of happiness disregarding recent events that may make us more happy or more sad. That is, after a long time, even if you win the lottery, or lose a limb, eventually, you will return to a certain level of happiness. <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in our pursuit of happiness, this particular information gives us no information other than the fact that we are born with unequal starting points of happiness, and that some people will always be happier than others. <h3>So what can we do?</h3>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the research of Sonja Lyubomirsky 50% of our happiness is based on that set point.  Another 10% is based on our circumstances which are largely unchangeable.  However a full 40% is based on our mindset which is entirely up to us and changeable at any time.</div>

                One of the first things I urge you to reflect on is why you are UCSD, what you aim to achieve here, and how far along are you on your planned path. Most students attend college in order to graduate with a degree, and enter the workforce as an educated individual. As a student of a top college like UCSD, although the work may be hard, the rewards will be greater. Or is it? Since we live in a capitalist society, one of the ideals pushed onto us is that money makes the world go round. Without it, we are unable to do what we want, achieve what we want, and in general, a lack of money will make us less happy. However, researcher (super complex name) has found that money and happiness have little to no correlation. Although money may help you buy materialistic things, are those really the things that will make you happy in the long run? Thus, it would be wise to change your mindset about grades. At this point in our short lives, grades have dictated our performance in life for the majority of our life. But, in the future, after college, grades are worth very little, so why split so many hairs worrying over that next final? As a student in college, you should attempt to socialize more. Get away from Geisel and that desk, go out, explore the sunlight, and make friends. In addition, one should really attempt to pursue their passion in a particular field compared to a career that brings in a lot of money. Else, you will find that the career is much more taxing and that performing the job will cause a state of unhappiness. Should you pursue a job with a passion, that job will bring around much more happiness in the long run. You will enjoy being on the job, even if the monetary value of the job is not up to par.

                The real core of obtaining happiness comes from our close relationships with others. As according to research seen in Piore’s article, happiness is only obtained after having personal relationships versus many fragile and superficial relationships. Thus, get away from instant messaging all of those facebook friends and meet them in real life, on campus. Even if you do obtain a lot of money, chances are, relationships may become more superficial because of this as people attempt to get closer to you in hopes of receiving benefits. So, although money can sometimes buy a close personal relationship, most likely, that relationship will be fake and you will be abandoned
                Why does college make you unhappy
                Successful in college
                As a college student, one of the most stress-causing problems is grades. This is especially true at a top competitive college like UCSD. Course workload may be higher, course material may be more in-depth, and lectures may not fully cover all intended material, causing students to spend significant time out of class to preparing for the class. This is turn, makes students stay indoors for longer periods of time, and forget that going outside and bathing in the sunlight is something that will increase health and decrease depression. Because studying usually requires a lot of individual effort, relationships are pushed to the side and ignored
                Attempting to study financially safe fields over passionate fields just to make money
                Since money is the main goal students hope for, there are many cases where students attempt to major in subjects that are projected to bring in alot of income instead of pursuing their actual interests. This causes greater stress for students, and will in turn increase the depression students may have. First off, the students passion for learning will not be invested in that particular major. This makes studying for that subject much more torturous since that student will perceive the material in a very dry manner and will easily get bored of the subject. Overall, this will lead to lower achievements in grades, which will also contribute to the student’s growing stress and state of unhappiness. But, the common assumption that money increases happiness still pushes the student to try harder, become more isolated, and disregard relationships
